title: 'Panda Kitchen and Bath Website'
description: 'A responsive marketing website built for Panda Kitchen & Bath to showcase products, generate customer inquiries, and attract new wholesale partners. Developed on Shopify, the site emphasizes product presentation and quote requests rather than direct sales, supporting both retail visibility and vendor outreach. I inherited this codebase from a development team that previously worked with Gorilla Marketing Group. Since then, I have made extensive changes and optimizations throughout the site, both as an employee of GMG and as a freelancer.'
